# TryHackMe: Intro to Offensive Security (Pre-Security Path)

## Room Overview

This room introduces the fundamentals of offensive security, where the goal is to simulate cyberattacks in a controlled environment to identify vulnerabilities.
It focuses on ethical hacking, penetration testing, and learning how attackers think ‚Äî so defenders can build better defenses.

## Key Learnings

### ‚öîÔ∏è Offensive Security Concepts

- Definition: Simulating real-world cyberattacks to find and fix security flaws.
- Goal: Strengthen systems by identifying weaknesses before attackers do.
- Difference from Defensive Security: Defensive secures systems; offensive tests their security through simulated attacks.
