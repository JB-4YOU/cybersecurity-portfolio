Defensive Security: Core Concepts
Primary Objectives:
Preventing Intrusions: Implementing measures to stop unauthorized access before it occurs.
Detecting and Responding to Intrusions: Identifying breaches promptly and mitigating their impact effectively.
Blue Team Role: Focuses on defensive strategies, contrasting with Red Teams that simulate attacks to test defenses.

Security Operations Center (SOC):
Function: A centralized unit comprising cybersecurity professionals who monitor and protect organizational networks and systems.

Key Responsibilities:
Monitoring for Vulnerabilities: Identifying and addressing system weaknesses.
Policy Enforcement: Ensuring compliance with security protocols and detecting violations.
Unauthorized Activity Detection: Spotting and responding to suspicious behaviors, such as compromised credentials.
Intrusion Response: Managing incidents like phishing attacks or exploited public servers. 

Threat Intelligence:
Purpose: Gathering and analyzing information about potential and actual threats to inform defense strategies.

Process:
Data Collection: Sourcing information from internal logs and external platforms.
Data Processing: Organizing collected data for analysis.
Analysis: Understanding attacker behaviors, motives, and tactics to anticipate and mitigate threats. 


Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR):
Digital Forensics: Investigating digital devices to uncover evidence of cyber incidents, such as unauthorized access or data breaches.

Incident Response:
Containment: Isolating affected systems to prevent spread.
Eradication: Removing malicious elements from the environment.
Recovery: Restoring systems to normal operations.

Post-Incident Analysis: Reviewing incidents to improve future responses. 

Malware Analysis:
Objective: Understanding malicious software to develop effective countermeasures.

Common Malware Types:
Ransomware: Encrypts user data, demanding payment for decryption keys.
Trojans: Disguised as legitimate software but perform malicious actions.
Viruses: Self-replicating programs that spread by infecting other files. 

Practical Application: SIEM Simulation:
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Tools that aggregate and analyze security data from various sources to detect threats.

Hands-On Exercise:
Alert Analysis: Identifying suspicious activities through SIEM alerts.
Threat Verification: Using tools to assess the legitimacy of potential threats.
Response Actions: Blocking malicious IP addresses and documenting incidents.

Outcome: Successfully mitigating a simulated threat, culminating in the flag THM{THREAT-BLOCKED}.
